		<p><strong><a id="international"></a>International customers</strong><br>
		Despite our cosmopolitan tendencies, Goorin Bros. does not currently ship hats directly to international customers from <a href="/">www.goorin.com</a>. In the meantime, we can recommend using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myus.com/en/our-services/">MyUS.com</a>. Serving our customers since 1997, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myus.com/en/our-services/">MyUS.com</a> has extensive experience in properly servicing international consumers, businesses and expatriates.

		<p>
			·         Please visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myus.com/en/our-services/">MyUS.com</a> and create an account. There is a fee to get yourself set up, a standard account ($10.00 fee) works great for most folks.<br>
			·         Select the Personal Shopper option (click the icon of the woman with the shopping bags).<br>
			·         Special Note: When you are preparing to place your order, you will be given the option to select “Do Not Repack”, which we ask you to please select. This will ensure that your package arrives packed securely, in the original packing provided by our warehouse.<br>
			·         Special Note: If you order feathers to accompany your hat, please do know that they can range between $20-50 each to import, depending upon customs.<br>
			·         <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myus.com/en/our-services/">MyUS.com</a> will assist with processing your order “third party” (they will purchase for you, and you will pay them in turn).<br>
			·         <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myus.com/en/our-services/">MyUS.com</a> will provide a shipment address in the US that will act as a forwarding point to you. We will ship to that address, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myus.com/en/our-services/">MyUs.com</a> will provide you with tracking and return/exchange support from that point forward.
